This repository contains python scripts about exercise: python练习册
I want to see if it can be shown in GitHubdesktop.
and I'm trying what is fetch. pull is get from web. push is upload to web. 
when several people may update the codes, you should first pull to download the newest version. 
if only me use the code, it's convenient to update locally and then push to Web. Next time when using it, there is no need to pull(because no one else change code).

echo "# green-hand" >> README.md
echo "# web location https://github.com/Florapie/green-hand.git"
echo "#exercise-004: calculate the number of each characterin an English article"

#git init
#git add README.md
#git commit -m "first commit"
#git remote add origin https://github.com/Florapie/green-hand.git
#git push -u origin master
